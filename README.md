# InsecureShip

InsecureShip is a deliberately vulnerable REST API built with Node.js that simulates a shipping and package delivery management platform. This **basic and minimalist** project was created for educational purposes only to demonstrate common API security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in an easy-to-understand format.

The application features different access levels (Customer, Employee, Manager, Admin), package tracking, delivery management, and payment processing - all implemented with intentional security flaws that showcase the OWASP API Top 10 2023 vulnerabilities in a straightforward, educational manner.

## Warning: Intentionally Vulnerable

This application is **vulnerable by default** and intentionally incorporates numerous security anti-patterns and bad practices that are easy to identify, including:

- Hardcoded credentials and secrets
- Insecure data validation
- Broken authentication mechanisms
- Excessive data exposure
- Lack of rate limiting
- Insecure direct object references
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Broken access controls
- Insecure configuration settings

## Purpose

InsecureShip is designed as a simple tool to:

- Provide a hands-on environment for practicing secure development techniques
- Demonstrate typical vulnerabilities found in insecure applications in a direct manner
- Serve as a training tool for identifying and remediating common API security issues
- Help developers easily understand the impact of security misconfigurations and bad practices through clear examples

## Disclaimer

This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities and should never be deployed in production environments or exposed to the internet. Use only in controlled, isolated environments for security training, demonstrations, and testing.

## Writeup Walkthrough & Resolution

**File:** [`Walkthrough - Writeup.md`](./Walkthrough%20-%20Writeup.md)

The following analysis presents a **possible approach** to **identifying and mitigating** certain **vulnerabilities** observed in the application.  
It should **not** be interpreted as a **definitive guide** or an **official security recommendation**.  
Rather, it is intended as an **educational example** to encourage **reflection** on potential **mitigation strategies**.

It is important to note that **additional vulnerabilities** may exist beyond those discussed here, and that **other mitigation methods** not covered in this document may also be applicable.


## Technologies

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB (without authentication, in Docker)

---

## Main Functionality

- User system with roles: `CUSTOMER`, `DRIVER`, `DISPATCHER`, `ADMIN`
- Package management (shipping, updating, assignment)
- Image processing from URL
- Remote command execution (RCE)
- Insecure JWT authentication

## Installation & Usage Guide – InsecureShip

InsecureShip is a deliberately vulnerable REST API built with Node.js and MongoDB (Dockerized) for learning about API security flaws, following the OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023). This guide will help you set it up and start exploring vulnerabilities step by step.

---

### Requirements

- **Node.js** (v22.8.0 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Postman** (for testing endpoints)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCyberpunker/InsecureShip.git
cd InsecureShip
```

### 2. Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start MongoDB (Dockerized)

Make sure Docker is running, then run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

This will spin up a local MongoDB instance on `mongodb://localhost:27017` with no authentication (intentionally insecure).

### 4. Start the Insecure API Server

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:

```
📦 Connected to MongoDB (Docker)
🚀 Insecure API running at http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Populate the Database with Sample Data (Optional)

To seed the MongoDB database with example users and packages:

```bash
node scripts/seed.js
```

### 6. Test the API with Postman

Import the following collection into Postman:
* `InsecureShip API.postman_collection.json`

This collection contains pre-configured requests to demonstrate each vulnerability.

### 7. Scan the Code for Known Vulnerabilities

You can use the included demo vulnerability scanner (`scripts/vulnchecker.js`) to detect insecure patterns.

```bash
npm run vulncheck
```

⚠️ This scanner is **for educational purposes only**. It simulates basic static analysis with regex. It is **not a real security tool**.

### 8. Optional: Secure Version

You can compare insecure and secure implementations to understand how to mitigate each issue. Look for clearly labeled corrected versions inside each route.

### Important Notes

* Do **NOT deploy** this app to any real or public environment.
* All vulnerabilities are **intentional** and marked clearly in code comments.
* Intended for use in **offline training labs**, workshops, and **security education**.
