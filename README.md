# InsecureShip
InsecureAPI is a deliberately vulnerable REST API built with Node.js that simulates a shipping and package delivery management platform. This project was created for educational purposes only to demonstrate common API security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
The application features different access levels (Customer, Employee, Manager, Admin), package tracking, delivery management, and payment processing - all implemented with intentional security flaws that showcase the OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities and should never be deployed in production environments or exposed to the internet. Use only in controlled, isolated environments for security training, demonstrations, and testing.
