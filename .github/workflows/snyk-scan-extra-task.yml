# 📌 Purpose:
#   This workflow automatically scans your project using Snyk
#   and posts a detailed comment on the Pull Request (PR)
#   with information about detected vulnerabilities.
#
# 🔍 What it does:
#   • Detects vulnerabilities of severity: critical, high, and medium.
#   • Determines whether each vulnerable dependency is:
#       - Direct  → installed explicitly in your package.json
#       - Transitive → installed indirectly through another package
#   • Generates a Markdown report (comment.md) for posting into PR.
#   • Fails the workflow if medium/high/critical vulnerabilities are found.
